# Web Drawing
## Description 
This is a repo holding my projects for the course CSCI-UA 380 Drawing on the Web at New York University. <br/>
We mainly explore how to use tech stacks like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Three.js and WebGL to foster a interactive relationship between user and web pages. <br/>
The url for the website is: http://gavinjin0501.github.io/drawing/. I strongly recommend to use browsers like Chrome and Firexfox to view this website since others may have some compatability issues.
